# Dom Challenges


## 1 Google Designer

- Search for anything on Google.
- Make all the H3 tags on the results page have a background color of red.


## 2 Wikiwriter 1.0

Wikipedia thinks it would be awesome if their articles "typed" themselves out over time, instead of all of the text showing up at once. They've hired you to build a prototype for them.

Write a function `wikiWriter` that, when called from the console on any Wikipedia article, clears the article text, and writes it back out to the page one character at a time.


## 3 Wikiwriter 2.0

Wikipedia loved your prototype, but one of the executives noticed that the typing looks a little fake because the typing rate is uniform. They think it would look better if there was a random delay between typing each character. They'd also like a longer delay after typing each period (.).


## 4 Doc Searcher

Write a function `searchPage` which takes a string as an argument, and returns true if that string appears anywhere on the page.

You may find Javascript's `match` function helpful.



## 5 Amaz(ing)on Images

Amazon wants an easy way to find all of the filenames for the images on any of their pages. They've hired you to help them out with this.

Write a function `findImages` that, when called on any page, returns an array of all the filenames of images on a page. Don't include the path to the file.

To make sure your code is clean, use your `map` function to help with this.

Try out your function on the Amazon homepage.
